# Niyati-Trail
This is project for a hackathon.
Niyati Trail provides a platform for women to showcase their skills such as pottery, tailoring, weaving, and cooking skills, among others, in order to increase their chances of being hired by recruiters. It expands the opportunities for shop owners and entrepreneurs to hire skilled workers. As a result, both parties benefit: those seeking employment and those seeking to hire workers.
