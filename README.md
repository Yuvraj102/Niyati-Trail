This is project for a hackathon.
Niyati Trail provides a platform for women to showcase their skills such as pottery, tailoring, weaving, and cooking skills, among others, in order to increase their chances of being hired by recruiters. It expands the opportunities for shop owners and entrepreneurs to hire skilled workers. As a result, both parties benefit: those seeking employment and those seeking to hire workers.
In the future, we hope to raise awareness about domestic violence among women by hosting a forum and encouraging them to speak out against it. Furthermore, we intend to raise sanitary hygiene awareness and provide healthcare services as needed.
